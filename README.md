# IMDB-scraper
THIS IS CODED ON VS CODE SOFTWARE

IN THIS I HAVE TAKEN THE TOP 250 MOVIES PAGE OF IMDB AND TRIED TO SCAPRE THE DATA OUT FROM IT....
THE DATA IS SCRAPED USING THE PYTHON MODULE <-BeautifulSoup->

THE DATA THAT ARE SCRAPED INCLUDE
1. RANK
2. NAME
3. YEAR
4. RATING

THE DATA AFTER SCRAPING IS THEN BEEN ARRANGED IN A EXCEL SHEET AND RETURNED TO THE USER

FOR EXCEL SHEETS THE MODULE THAT I HAVE USED IS openpyxl
THIS IS A BUILT IN FUNCTION IN PYTHON

HOPE THIS PROJECT HELPED YOU
